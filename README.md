# Bank Account Management System

## **Project Overview**

The **Bank Account Management System** is a C++ project designed to demonstrate the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) such as **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**. This system allows users to create bank accounts, view account details, and perform transactions like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers—all through a command-line interface.
